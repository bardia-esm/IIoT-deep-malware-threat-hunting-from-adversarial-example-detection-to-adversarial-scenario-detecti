# IIoT deep malware threat hunting: from adversarial example detection to adversarial scenario detection
The codebase for **IIoT deep malware threat hunting: from adversarial example detection to adversarial scenario detection** accepted at **IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics**.
The material in ```main.py``` includes the code for training a CNN-based classifier on 2d malware images and then training a similarity encoder over these images. Adversaial malware images are detected based on the similarity of the encoding of the current sample and previous samples.
